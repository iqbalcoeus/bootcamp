Here are some simple steps to make Vhost.

1. Create a file .conf in /etc/apache2/sites-available with following content...

{

<VirtualHost *:80>
  # The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that
  # the server uses to identify itself. This is used when creating
  # redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName
  # specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
  # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
  # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
  # However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.
  ServerName domainName
  ServerAlias www.DomainName

  ServerAdmin webmaster@domainName.com
  <Directory /var/www/Directory_Path/>
          Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    AllowOverride All
    Order allow,deny
    allow from all
  </Directory>
  DocumentRoot /var/www/Directory_Path/

  # Available loglevels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn,
  # error, crit, alert, emerg.
  # It is also possible to configure the loglevel for particular
  # modules, e.g.
  #LogLevel info ssl:warn

  ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
  CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

  # For most configuration files from conf-available/, which are
  # enabled or disabled at a global level, it is possible to
  # include a line for only one particular virtual host. For example the
  # following line enables the CGI configuration for this host only
  # after it has been globally disabled with "a2disconf".
  #Include conf-available/serve-cgi-bin.conf
</VirtualHost>

# vim: syntax=apache ts=4 sw=4 sts=4 sr noet
}

2. Run this command on terminal : "a2ensite FileName.conf"   Note: FilaeName here is the file created in 1st step.

3. go to /etc/hosts  file and Write following line in it  

   127.0.0.1   DomainName

4. run sudo service apache2 reload 

Vhost should work now!
